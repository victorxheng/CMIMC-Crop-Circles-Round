# CMIMC-Crop-Circles-Round
My First Place submission for the Carnegie Mellon Mathematics and Informatics Competition Optimization Round: Crop Circles category.

-Goal: Find the coordinate points of a list of circles with varying radii to cover the maximum number of given coordinate points possible on a plane
-Input: Large list of coordinate points (in a random layout) and list of radii
-Output: List of points with the goal to cover as many of the points possible with the circles
-Time: Around 1 week, with six different data sets, and a final score being a combination of the performance in each one.

cropgraphprecise.java: final code
opitmization2: experimental code to test smaller circles on data set. Did not affect the end result
